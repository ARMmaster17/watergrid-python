## Pull Requests
Please follow the pull request submission template when submitting pull requests. The more detailed
you are, the faster your pull requests will be reviewed.

Note that there are several required checks that must pass before your pull request can be approved.
All pull requests are tested against all non-EoL stable Python versions. Additionally, the watergrid
project uses the `black` tool to format code. It is recommended that you run this tool locally before
comitting to reduce GitHub Actions usage. Code Climate also analyzes test coverage, and your pull
request may be rejected if it does not test at least half of all new code, or reduces the overall project
coverage by 1% or more.
